# creatures

* folder 'phoneControlled' is for the Arduino Nano with two stepper motors and one servo.
  * to upload this sketch to the Nano you probably need to first install the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) 
  * and then a [USB driver for the Arduino clone](http://www.wch.cn/download/CH341SER_ZIP.html) that you will use. Look for a familiar operating system...
  * modify the code so that it resembles your assembly, for instance if you have less motors
  * test your modifications carefully outside of your robot so that you avoid breaking stuff
* folder 'eyes' is for the remote controlled eyes. See the README in there to figure out how to install and run it...

## For historical reference only
* folder 'creature' is for the Arduino UNO with one stepper motor
* folder 'creature2' is for the Arduino Leonardo with one servo motor
